		<h2>Parallax Scroling  Effects</h2>
		<p>The parallax effect has been around for years in classic video games, but it became a trend in the web design world. This cool effect is now commonly seen as part of the scrolling feature of a web page. It uses multiple backgrounds which seem to move at different speeds to create a sensation of depth (creating a faux-3D effect) and an interesting browsing experience. Nearby objects have a larger parallax than more distant objects when observed from different positions, so parallax scrolling can be used to determine distances. We have compiled 30 of the best amazing examples of websites that use the scrolling parallax effect.The parallax effect has been around for years in classic video games, but it became a trend in the web design world.
